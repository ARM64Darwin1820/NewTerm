# NewTerm
This is a rewrite of the original NewTerm project, which was forked from [Mobile Terminal](http://cydia.saurik.com/package/mobileterminal-applesdk). Mobile Terminal’s codebase dates from the iPhone OS 2.0 – 3.0 era, and prior to this it was written for iPhone OS 1.0 (before an official SDK existed). The newer Mobile Terminal that most people know and love is actually a very unfinished rewrite of [the old Mobile Terminal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YykPoy83Jrg), which had substantially more features. There have been many significant improvements to iOS frameworks since then, so it was decided the best way to go from here was to rewrite the majority of the app.
